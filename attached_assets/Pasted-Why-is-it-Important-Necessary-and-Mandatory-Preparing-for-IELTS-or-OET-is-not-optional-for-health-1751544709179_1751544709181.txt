Why is it Important (Necessary and Mandatory)?
Preparing for IELTS or OET is not optional for healthcare professionals and students aiming to study, work, or register abroad‚Äîit is a mandatory requirement:

IELTS: A high score (typically 7.0+) is essential for academic or professional pathways, including higher education or immigration processes in English-speaking countries.

OET: Grade B is required by regulatory bodies like NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) and GMC (General Medical Council) in the UK for nurses and doctors. It is equivalent to IELTS 7 or CEFR C1 level and directly linked to safety and communication standards in healthcare.

Failure to achieve these standards may delay registration, block immigration, or limit access to better job and study opportunities
